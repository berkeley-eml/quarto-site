# Downtimes

## Scheduled Downtimes

Every attempt will be made to schedule downtimes during off hours.

Scheduled system downtime is posted in the ssh login message. An attempt will
be made to post the message at least 24 hours in advance. The announcement will
state the date(s) and time(s) of the downtime and every attempt will be made
not to exceed the posted downtime hours. Whenever possible, 10 minutes warning
will be given prior to shutting the system down.

## Unscheduled Downtimes

All systems will be taken down under the following circumstances:

 -  Emergency hardware or software conditions may occur, including
    emergency filesystem repair, which may result in unscheduled system
    downtime. As much advance warning as possible will be given; but at
    times the system must be taken down rapidly to avoid further damage
    to hardware or other system resources.

 -  If it is transparent to all users (which in practice means that
    there are no users on the system and no user background jobs
    running) the system may be taken down (for no more than 30 minutes)
    without advance message of the day warning.

 -  The machines usually can reboot themselves from a crash, but
    occasionally the system will be unavailable until a qualified person
    can be reached.
