EML Computing Cluster
=====================

The Econometrics Laboratory (EML) has a high-performance computing
cluster that consists of low priority partition and a high priority
partition. This system allow users to work with massive data sets and
easily manage long-running jobs. All software running on EML Linux
machines is available on the cluster. Users can also compile programs on
any EML Linux machine and then run that program on the cluster. It is
managed by the SLURM queuing software. SLURM provides a standard batch
queuing system through which users submit jobs to the cluster. Jobs are
typically submitted to SLURM using a user-defined shell script that
executes one's application code. Interactive use is also an option.
Users may also query the cluster to see job status.

The high priority partition has has eight nodes, divided into two sets
of four nodes each. The first set has four nodes each with two 8-core
CPUs. Each core has two hyperthreads, for a total of 128 processing
units. Each node has 768 GB dedicated RAM. The second set has four nodes
each with two 14-core CPUs. Each core has two hyperthreads, for a total
of 224 processing units. Each node has 132 GB dedicated RAM. The lower
priority partition has has eight nodes, each with two 16-core CPUs
available for compute jobs (i.e., 32 cores per node), for a total of 256
cores. Each node has 248 GB dedicated RAM.
