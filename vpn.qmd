Using the Campus VPN
--------------------

1.  Download the AnyConnect software from the bottom of its [Software
    Central page](https://software.berkeley.edu/cisco-vpn).
2.  Run the AnyConnect client and on the Connection tab, in the field
    marked **Connect to**Â enter *ucbvpn.berkeley.edu* as the hostname.
3.  When prompted enter your CalNet credentials for the username and
    password fields.
4.  Choose a connection group. The first option is suitable for most
    cases:
    -   **1-Campus\_VPN**: tunnel only campus traffic through the VPN
    -   **2-Campus\_VPN\_Full\_Tunnel:** tunnel all of your internet
        traffic through it
    -   **3-Library\_VPN groups**: just library traffic
5.  Click the **Connect** button.
