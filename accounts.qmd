# Accounts

## Get an Account

Fill in the EML application form

- [Those with Calnet ID](https://eml.berkeley.edu/account)
- [Those without Calnet ID](https://docs.google.com/a/berkeley.edu/forms/d/1loDJ_f7pX8ZefIDqDFZNXSqBWyCKQ1QjL10aUj3cJTs)
- [Research Project Account](forms/projectapp.pdf)

Read the [EML rules](rules.qmd), the [UC Berkeley computer use
policies](http://cio.berkeley.edu/policies.html), and all accompanying
guidelines that accompany the application form.

Obtain a faculty signature (if you are a graduate student), or a
principal investigator's signature for research project accounts, and
the EML manager's signature (643 Evans Hall).

Sign the project account application form stating that you have read the
rules, you understand them, and you will comply with them.

Take the project account application form to 643 Evans to establish your
login name and your password.

You will receive an e-mail confirming your account has been set up.

## Initial Disk Space

The allocation of disk space on all accounts is controlled by disk
quotas. Below are the default allocations for home directories:

 - Graduate students: 5 GB
 - Faculty: 5 GB
 - Staff: 1 GB
 - Visiting Faculty: 1 GB
 - Guest Accounts: 1 GB

Monitor your [disk quota](disk-quota.qmd) to ensure proper functioning of your
account.

If more disk space is required, users can request additional space by
providing written justification to the EML manager. It is expected that
requests for increased disk allocation come after basic account
maintenance: deletion of files in trash, removal of obsolete data,
archiving or compressing of no longer used files, and so forth.

All users have access to additional [temporary disk space](temp-space.qmd) on
the EML system.

Users are recommended to store critical files and confidential files
safely in personal accounts, and use the unix file permissions to make
these files secure and private (see `man chmod`). Delete any old files
that are no longer needed or that can be easily re-created. Compress
large files. The command `bigfiles` will show you your biggest files
when invoked in your current working directory.
