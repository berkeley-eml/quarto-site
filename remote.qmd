# Remote Access to the EML Systems

You can securely connect to the EML using either your browser (via JupyterHub),
or using secure shell (SSH).

## JupyterHub

[EML's JupyterHub](https://jupyter.econ.berkeley.edu) is deployed for
users to remotely run Jupyter notebooks (using Python, R, Julia, MATLAB
and other languages), terminal sessions, RStudio, and even graphical
Remote Desktop sessions on EML machinesthrough your web browser. See
[our JupyterHub documentation](jupyterhub.qmd) for more information.

## SSH

You can connect using SSH to a number of EML systems. The list of hostnames
users can access is listed on our [dashboards](monitoring.qmd).

### Connecting from Windows

#### Command-line Access

[PuTTY](http://www.putty.org) is a free SSH client for Windows.

#### Using Graphical User Interface of Unix Applications

[Xming](http://sourceforge.net/projects/xming/) is X Windows Software
from X.Org ported to Microsoft Windows. This requires the use of an SSH
client such as PuTTY.

    (file explorer), etc on PuTTY's command-line window.

#### Remote (Graphical) Desktop Environment Access

[Windows Remote Desktop](rdp.qmd) allows remote desktop connections to the
EML Linux systems. [X2Go](x2go.qmd) is a remote desktop solution that
