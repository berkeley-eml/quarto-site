# Restrictions and Limitations

EML student accounts are issued only to students who are currently
registered with the University of California at Berkeley, and all
accounts are subject to approval. An account is issued to a specific
individual who is responsible for all activity within his/her account
and who agrees not to allow any other individual to access his/her
account. EML policies apply to all accounts, and acceptance of an
account implies acknowledgement and acceptance of all EML policies. An
EML account is a privilege and as such can be revoked if misused. Any
graduate student who receives a degree from the Department of Economics
is eligible for an "alumni" account, a one-year extension of his/her
student account upon graduation. Alumni accounts require the sponsorship
of a faculty member within the Department of Economics.

Accounts that are issued to students, alumni, guests, and visitors will
be closed on January 1 and July 1 of each year. ONLY accounts belonging
to currently registered Economics graduate students will remain open
beyond that date. Individuals having other accounts must apply for an
extension. No extensions are granted for class accounts.

Class accounts will be removed after 3PM of the first Monday after final
exams of the semester for which they were assigned. Be sure to make any
arrangements for permanent or backup storage of your class account files
before the accounts are closed. There will be a $20 fee (plus the cost
of media) for recovering files from accounts that have been closed. Upon
request, mail messages can be forwarded to another account for up to 60
days after an account has been closed. (This does not apply to class
accounts.)

All user accounts have disk use quotas which impose an absolute limit on
the amount of disk space the account may consume. For more information,
see "[What is my disk quota?](https://eml.berkeley.edu/498)". User
accounts are also subject to periodic purging of certain files.Â 

Be warned that abuse of any account on any EML UNIX system (or any other
computer system) may lead to termination of that account and suspension
of all EML system privileges for the offender. "Abuse of an account"
includes, but is not limited to: repeated failure to follow posted rules
for use of terminal rooms; playing of games; unauthorized attempts to
access accounts, files, or system resources not one's own; malicious
mischief of any sort; and failure to cooperate with requests of the
System Staff regarding use of system resources. Files under accounts are
not personal property; as such the EML reserves the right to review,
modify, or delete any file or terminate any activity that may interfere
with the operations or security of the EML.
