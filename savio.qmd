title: EML Condo Node at Savio
---

EML has purchased two nodes in a condo at Savio, the high-performance
computational cluster managed by the Berkeley Research Computing (BRC) program.
As of 2024, these nodes are quite old won't have as high performance as new
Savio nodes or as new nodes on the EML, but they are available, and in
addition, because of the condo, users are entitled to use the extra resource
available on the Savio cluster through a low priority QoS.

If you are interested in using this resource, please create an account at the
[MyBRC user portal](https://mybrc.brc.berkeley.edu). Once your account is
created and you've signed the cluster user access agreement, from the welcome
page, click on *Join* next to *Create or join a project*. Look for `co_econ`
and click *Join* next to it. You will receive notification when your request
has been approved.

Instructions on how to access the SAVIO cluster, hardware details, filesystems,
job scheduler, and how to submit jobs to the condo all are available at the
[user
guide](https://docs-research-it.berkeley.edu/services/high-performance-computing/user-guide/).
