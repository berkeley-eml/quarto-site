    Any individual found accessing another individual's account will

        his/her account.

    -   Send mail to "manager" immediately if you suspect that someone
        has gained access to your account.

2.  Abuse of any computer account by an individual within the EML system
    or abuse of any other computer system may lead to termination of the
    individual's EML account and permanent suspension of all EML system
    privileges. Abuse of an account includes, but is not limited to:

    -   Unauthorized attempts to access accounts, files, or system
        resources.

    -   Malicious mischief of any sort.

    -   Any activity originating from a local account (on any computer

        not known to the user and/or the recipient.

    -   Use of electronic communications for advertising, selling,
        personal solicitations, or sending chain letters (The use of

        use of system resources.

    -   Playing of games.

    -   Repeated failure to follow posted rules.

3.  Individuals are not allowed to connect or remove computer equipment
    to or from the network connections in any room or office. An
    individual may request a connection for a personal computer and will
    be assigned a DHCP connection to use with the purple cables
    installed in offices. Attempting to attach any other computer
    equipment to an office network outlet is prohibited. This includes
    connecting switches, hubs, laptops or other computers from outside
    of the department.

    All network connections within the department are controlled by the
    EML. All network related requests for service or reports of problems
    should be directed to the EML.

4.  The contents of all accounts (including files that are owned or
    created by the user regardless of location) are subject to copyright
    laws, and all users must comply with those laws. All "original works
    of authorship" that are produced or distributed are covered by
    copyright law. An individual can not store or distribute (make
    available), in part or in whole, any item that is protected by
    copyright law without the written permission of the copyright owner.
    In order not to fall under the provisions of Senate Bill 1386, users
    are prohibited from storing/creating information that contains an
    individuals name in combination with personal information as defined
    by either a social security number, drivers license number, or
    financial/credit card number.

5.  EML accounts are not to be used for storing personal music or videos
    not directly related to course work or research. EML accounts can be
    used to transfer personal music or video files but the files must be
    removed within 48 hours.

6.  Restrictions on files located under the home directory with names
    that begin with a '.' prefix (referred to as 'dot' files):

    -   Only the owner is permitted to have "write" access to a 'dot'
        file.

    -   Dot files can not be a 'link' to a file outside of the user's
        account.

    -   A ".rhosts" file can not contain the name of any non-EML
        computer. Undergraduate class accounts are prohibited from using
        a ".rhosts" file.

7.  Limitations on the use of computer resources require that users do
    not run more that one large job on a computer at a time and do not
    run jobs on more than 8 computers simultaneously. When printing do
    not place more than 10 jobs in a printer queue. For information on
    resource usage see "help bigjobs".

8.  Remove messages from the incoming mail file after they have been
    read. Do not save messages in the incoming mail file
    (/var/mail/\[user-name\]). If the incoming mail file grows to more
    than 0.1MB the mail file will be truncated and messages older than
    30 days may be automatically deleted. Class accounts can not be used
    to subscribe to news groups, listing services, or are allowed to
    post messages to the net.

9.  Users are restricted to creating and modifying files under their
    account (home directory). With the exception of the use of the
    directory "/tmp" the placement or modification of files in any other
    location without authorization is prohibited. The /tmp directory can
    be used for temporary (one day only) storage of files. Files older
    than 24 hours will be automatically deleted, but users should remove
    their files as soon as their work has been completed (See "help
    tmp").
