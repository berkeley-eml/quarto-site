Electrical Load Test 10/23 and 10/30  
The EML server room will be brought offline on the mornings of 10/23 and
10/30 for an electrical load test. On 10/23, electricity to our server
room will be turned off so that campus can install monitoring equipment.
Power will be restored shortly after and we will then bring all
equipment and services online. This will repeat on 10/30 when the
monitoring equipment will be removed. We do not yet know the time or
duration of each event, however we anticipate they will probably be in
the early morning and last for a couple of hours.
