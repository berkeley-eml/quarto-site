# Disk Space and Quota

Each user is assigned a disk space quota, or allotment, for their
home directory when their
account is created to insure that there will be sufficient disk space
for all our users' needs.

Once you are over quota, programs may fail to run and you may also be prevented
from logging in.

In addition, upon request we can provide additional (often much larger) amounts of "scratch" space, which is generally used for downloaded input data or produced output that doesn't need to be backed up.

Each user is expected to monitor their own disk usage and to attempt to
stay within their quota. To view your current usage in your home directory and scratch directory, type `quota` on the command line.

The best practice is to check your quota occasionally, and if it appears
you are nearing your limit, you should see what files you may be able to
remove from your account to provide yourself with more disk space.

You should never need to remove files that you need in order to meet
your disk quota. If you need more space, please email us at
trouble@econ.berkeley.edu. When you do so, please let us know how much space you think you need and if you think you need backed-up space or if scratch space could be used (e.g., for datasets or output that don't need to be backed up).
