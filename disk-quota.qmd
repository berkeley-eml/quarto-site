# Disk Quota

Each user is assigned a disk space quota, or allotment, when their
account is created to insure that there will be sufficient disk space
for all our users' needs.

Once you are over quota, programs may fail to run and you may also be prevented
from logging in.

Each user is expected to monitor their own disk usage and to attempt to
stay within their quota. To view your current usage, type `quota` on the
command line.

The best practice is to check your quota occasionally, and if it appears
you are nearing your limit, you should see what files you may be able to
remove from your account to provide yourself with more disk space.

You should never need to remove files that you need in order to meet
your disk quota. If you anticipate a long-term need for an unusually
large amount of disk space, please notify the EML staff before the need
becomes acute, so that we can find a suitable location for your files
without encroaching on the files of other users. Additional disk space
may be requested by sending mail to manager@econ.berkeley.edu.
