# Compute Servers Policy

Access to the compute server nerlove is restricted to individuals who
have obtained instructions regarding the use and limitations of running
jobs on the compute servers. Please contact the EML staff to register as
a compute server user or to schedule access to additional resources on
the EML compute servers. Only individuals who have registered as a
compute server are allowed to use the compute servers. When registering,
users will need to identify the computational resources required for
their work and their ability to monitor the status of those jobs. User
names will be added to a mailing list to be used for announcements
concerning scheduling of special projects and downtimes for maintenance
and repairs.

Please observe the following policies:

-   Access to the compute servers is restricted to individuals who are
    familiar with running batch jobs in a UNIX/Linux environment. If you
    are not familiar with running jobs in this way, you can contact
    consult@econ.berkeley.edu.

-   Jobs must be nice'd to a value of 19. Any job that is running on a
    compute server with a lower priority (without prior authorization)
    may be terminated.

-   The maximum number of jobs can be running on a server at any one
    time is equal to the number of processors. The number of CPUs on a
    machine can be seen on our [Grafana dashboards](monitoring.qmd). If you
    see (using top) that all CPUs are busy, do not run/start a job on
    that server until resources become available.

-   A user should not run so many simultaneous jobs on a compute server
    such that other users are prevented from starting jobs due to lack
    of resources. This policy is intended to ensure that CPU cycles and
    memory are used fairly and effectively.Â Accommodations will be made
    based on availability and the current needs of the user community.
    Please send mail to "manager" if you need temporary or long term
    access to additional computing resources.

-   Use the command `sitehosts cserver` for the list of computers
    whose use is restricted and covered by these rules.
