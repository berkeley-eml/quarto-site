# Tensorflow

## Why does Tensorflow fail with an "Illegal Instruction"?

Recent versions of Tensorflow by default make use of AVX instructions, a
feature of newer chips. If Tensorflow is run on these older machines,
the instruction is not available and the error occurs. To avoid this,
when submitting your job via Slurm, include \`-c avx\`. If you are
directly accessing a compute server, you can run \`grep avx
/proc/cpuinfo | wc - l\`. If the result is \`0\`, the AVX instructions
are not available and you should use a newer machine, such as klein,
fargo, quesnay, or sargan.
